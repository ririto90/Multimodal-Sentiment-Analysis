given by the platformdirs library.  To remove this warning and
see the appropriate new directories, set the environment variable
`JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1` and then run `jupyter --paths`.
The use of platformdirs will be the default in `jupyter_core` v6

Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
